development.
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding
  class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that
  interacts with views.
- [Room DB](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Used to locally store our data.
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - For dependency injection.
- [Data Binding](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Used especially to bind data to the recyclerview.
- [Material Design](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Core design principles used to design the application.
- [Navigation Component](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Navigation system through the app.
